Differential distribution of OI-linked PLS3 mutants in spreading XTC fibroblasts. **a**–**f** Localization of PLS3 variants at the cell periphery was assessed by TIRFM in live XTC cells co-transfected with mEmerald-PLS3 constructs, mCardinal-paxillin, and mCherry-actinin. For each PLS3 construct, sets of individual channel images along with two-channel (PLS3 and paxillin) and three-channel (PLS3, paxillin, and actinin) overlays are shown. Graphs represent fluorescence intensity profiles along the 15-μm-long lines indicated by white arrows; plot colors match those of the corresponding fluorescent channels. Note differential distribution of OI PLS3 mutants between the leading edge (LE) and FAs. **g** Co-localization of mEmerald-PLS3-WT with FAs (mCardinal-paxillin) and SFs (mCherry-actinin) in cells with high levels of expression cultured in Ca<sup>2+</sup>\-free medium. In the boxed areas, identical horizontal 12-μm-long lines were drawn (centrally, along the long axis) in each channel starting from the FA through the actin SF. Line intensity profiles show co-localization of PLS3 with actinin patches on the SFs and at the FAs (note that PLS3 localization is shifted towards the cell center)
